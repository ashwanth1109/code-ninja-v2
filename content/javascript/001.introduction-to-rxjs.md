In this lesson, we’ll be covering the basic concepts in Reactive Programming such as Observables, Observers, Subscriptions. 
Marble diagrams are the standard way that operators are explained in the docs, so we will also look at how marble diagrams can be interpreted. 
We’ll also look at some reactive code and at the different ways of creating and subscribing to observables, along with an example of working with pipeable operators. 
We’ll round it off with a comparison between a Reactive approach vs a Proactive approach.

## Preface

If you’ve ever worked with Angular, there’s a good chance you’ve already seen RxJS in action. When I started working with the Reactive programming paradigm, it took me a while to be able to think about my system in a Reactive manner. I found the plethora of concepts that come with the framework to be a little challenging at first.
While it may be tempting to just jump in and start trying to figure out how to use RxJS operators from the documentation, in my experience, this can lead you down a path where you don’t have a clear understanding of what’s actually going on. I think it’s certainly worth your time to understand the basics of what Reactive programming is, and being able to **think from a reactive perspective on how events drive your system**, using first principles.

## What is RxJS?

RxJS is a library that helps you write code in the Reactive programming paradigm. A programming paradigm, in simple terms, is just a way of thinking about your code. It’s a mental model of how to write your code to achieve certain benefits. You’ve probably used some popular paradigms such as Imperative, Object-oriented, and Functional programming paradigms. Like Functional, Reactive is a declarative paradigm and is in some ways an extension of the Functional paradigm, in that it uses several concepts of Functional programming. 
The Reactive paradigm is primarily concerned with **asynchronous data streams called Observables, and the propagation of change in your system**. A Reactive application will "REACT" to events. For example, a user clicking a button is an event. Your application can react to this event. Observables are an alternative to promises, and in many ways they can be similar but also very different. Check out this [awesome talk from Ben Lesh on this topic](https://youtu.be/KOOT7BArVHQ?t=365).

## A real-world analogy

To understand the notion of Observables, Observers and Subscriptions, I will use an analogy from the real-world, so that its easier to understand these concepts. Keep in mind, that this is merely an analogy, so there will be points where the two models in the analogy will deviate from each other. You can think of an Observable as a YouTube channel.

![YouTube Channel](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/youtube-channel.png)

A channel can have several events that occur. For example, it can have an upload event when a video is uploaded to the channel. You can subscribe to the channel, and you will get Notifications whenever the channel has an event. You can react to this event, say that of a video upload event by clicking on the new video to watch it. You can also unsubscribe from this channel to stop receiving notifications about events. 
An observable works pretty much the same way. An observable has events. You can subscribe or unsubscribe to an Observable. You get notifications on events, and a subscriber can react to events.

![Observer-Subscription](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/observer-subscription.png)

A subscriber is called an Observer in this paradigm. From our previous analogy, you as the user are the observer. You can observe the channel for events. When you, the observer subscribes to a channel, you have an active subscription. So, in the reactive paradigm, **an observer can subscribe to an observable to create a subscription**.

## Interpreting marble diagrams

![Event Timeline](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/event-timeline.png)

You can distill useful information into an event timeline. In the above timeline, the white arrow represents the flow of time. We are typically interested in the timeline only after you subscribe and have a running subscription. Our timeline starts when the "subscribe" method is called. Once you subscribe, after some time, the observable can have an event which is represented as a yellow dot on this timeline. Whenever there is an event on the observable, the observer is notified of this event. You can unsubscribe from the observable at any point of time. 
I do also want to mention here, that **Observables are "lazy" by nature**. So, they do not emit any events if there is no observer that has subscribed to it. This is a bit of deviation from our analogy. Because, you can have a YouTube channel with 0 subscribers and still have events occurring on the channel. This event timeline gives us a very nice segway into understanding "how to interpret" Marble Diagrams.

![Marble Diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/marble-diagram.png)

The above is an example of a marble diagram. You will usually see different variations of this in different sites or documentation, but the way to interpret these diagrams can be extended across all these sites. 
The arrow on the top is our observable, the source for all our events. As time goes on, you can have different events that can occur, either spaced out or in rapid succession. The value of the event emitted can be transformed before it reaches the observer using operators. You can have one, or many operators that transform this data. You can even have operators that dispatch side effects (for example the tap operator, which is super useful for debugging purposes). An important thing to note here, is that **any event that occurs on the observable after the observer unsubscribes from the observable, is not notified to the observer**.

## Creating observables

You can create an observable by importing in the "Observable" class from rxjs. You use the "new" keyword to create an instance of the observable class, and you need to pass in a callback as an argument to the constructor.

```js
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

const observable = new Observable((subscriber) => {
  subscriber.next(1);
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next(2);
    subscriber.complete();
  }, 1000);
});
```

Inside this callback, we ask the observable to emit events using the next method. The observable will first emit the value 1. Because we have a set timeout, the emission of the next value is delayed. The value 2, is emitted 1000ms after the value 1 was emitted. After 2 is emitted, we then call the complete method to terminate or clean up the observable. 
Like I mentioned before, because Observables are lazy by nature, the observable created here is not emitting any value just yet. It needs a subscriber to subscribe to it before it can emit the values 1 and 2.

![Example Timeline](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/example-timeline.png)

Once we have an observer which subscribes to the observable, the value 1 is emitted at approximately 0ms from the start of our subscription. And 1000ms later, our next value 2 is emitted, and then immediately after that the observable completes.

You would usually not create observables using the "Observable" class though. Rxjs provides several utility methods that can assist you with the creation of an observable. You have the “of” method which takes in a series of values as parameters. Your observable will then emit these values when subscribed. You can create the exact same observable using the “from” method as well. The only difference here is that you would pass the values to be emitted as an array.

```js
import { from, of } from "rxjs";

const observable1 = of(1, 2);
const observable2 = from([1, 2]);
```

## Subscribing to observables

We can subscribe to an observable using the "subscribe" method.

```js
import { of } from "rxjs";

const observable = of(1, 2);

const observer = {
  next: (val) => console.log(val),
  error: (err) => console.error(err),
  complete: () => console.log("Complete"),
};

const subscription1 = observable.subscribe(observer);
subscription1.unsubscribe();
```

You can pass in an object as a parameter with the properties next, error and complete defined. This object with these properties is your observer. The "subscribe" method returns a subscription object. The subscription object has the "unsubscribe" method, which you can call to unsubscribe from the observable. Every time the observable emits a value, this value is passed into the next callback. If there is an error thrown in the observable, the error is passed into the error callback. When the observable terminates, the complete callback is invoked.

```js
// Shorthand method
const subscription2 = observable.subscribe(
  (val) => console.log(val),
  (err) => console.error(err),
  () => console.log("Complete")
);
```

RxJS provides a shorthand way to call subscribe and pass in the next, error and complete callbacks directly, instead of defining them as properties in an object. This is usually the preferred way to subscribe to an observable.

## Working with pipeable operators

Operators are the bread and butter of the reactive paradigm. We have already seen some creation operators like **of** and **from**, which help with the creation of observables. **fromEvent** is another such creation operator, that helps to create observables from events, for example the click event.

```js
import { fromEvent } from "rxjs";
import { scan } from "rxjs/operators";

fromEvent(document, "click")
  .pipe(scan((count) => count + 1, 0))
  .subscribe((count) => console.log("Clicked " + count + "times"));
```

In the code above, we are creating an observable that will emit every time a user clicks on the document or the web page. However, we don’t directly call the "subscribe" method on the observable. Instead, we call the "pipe" method and then chain the "subscribe" method. On each click, the click event is passed through the pipe and then to the observer. The pipe method is used to transform each event using pipeable operators and passing on this transformed event data to the observer or subscriber. 
In the above example we see the usage of a pipeable operator, the **scan** operator. The **scan** operator works similar to array **reduce** method in javascript. It takes a seed value of 0 which is set to the variable named count and each time the observable emits a value, it will increment this count value and pass the count value to the observer.

## Why Reactive?

One question you might be asking yourself at this point is, "why should I write reactive code in the first place?". There are some obvious benefits listed on the [ReactiveX website](http://reactivex.io/) about how Observables make your life so much easier, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations. But, I would like to elaborate on one other important benefit.

![Proactive Approach](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/proactive-approach.png)

I will try to explain this benefit using the above example which uses the Proactive approach. Imagine you have 2 modules, Module1 and Module2. In Module1 you have your handleClick method attached as the event listener to the document. On "click", the handleClick method invokes the increment method from Module2. Module2 has the counter state, and an increment method which updates this state. So, in this example, we have Module1 driving the state & behavior of Module2 using the increment method. Therefore, we can say that **Module2 is passive** and allows other modules to change its state. This means **Module1 is now responsible for changing Module2’s state correctly**.

![Reactive Approach](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/reactive-approach.png)

In Reactive, we invert this relationship. Here we have Module1, which creates a clickObservable, and we have Module2, which subscribes to this observable from Module1. So, we have Module2 listening to Module1 for any events emitted within Module1. Thus, we can say **Module2 is reactive** and drives its own behavior and state when a click event is emitted. To re-emphasize, **Module2 is responsible for acting upon its own state**.

Therefore, the benefit of Reactive here, is that it drives the implementation of **self-responsible modules** which focus on their own functionality rather than changing external state. This builds on the principle of **Separation of Concerns**, which is widely agreed upon as a core principle when writing software.

## Going Forward

![Going forward](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-ninja.xyz/assets/intro-to-rxjs/going-forward.png)

Since this is purely an introduction to RxJS, the idea was to focus on building the basics so that you can start working with the Reactive paradigm on your own. Going forward, I would recommend that you look into the following points:

- The biggest challenge with reactive programming is this paradigm shift of being able to follow the Reactive approach over the Proactive approach by default.
- Another key challenge is that there is a multitude of operators available for different situations and being able to identify which operator is needed for which situation takes time and experience.
- When working with Observables, it’s also important that you are aware of the notion of Hot and Cold observables and understand when you have a need for a Hot observable.
- RxJS also has Subjects which are a special type of Observable that lets you multicast values to many observers, and you will probably end up needing to use Subjects very frequently. You also have more specialized versions of Subjects such as BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject and AsyncSubject which can be useful based on your need.
- Another thing you should be aware off, is that you can test your asynchronous RxJS code using Marble Syntax resulting tests that run synchronously and deterministically.

I plan to cover all of these concepts in future lessons. In the meanwhile, I hope you’ve found this introduction an easy way to get familiar with the reactive paradigm.
