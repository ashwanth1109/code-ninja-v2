Last week, I took part in my first ever Hackathon, and I presented a tool called **DevLauncher**, and I'm excited to share that I won the event. I had a couple of takeaways from the experience, and I will share them in this article.

If you would like to see the results of the hackathon, you can check them out [here on this link](https://start.devspaces.com/devspaces-hackathon/#winners1).

You can also see my submission/demo video below:

The category of the event was to find ways to improve team productivity by building extensions, or developing a workflow, with a new product called **DevSpaces**. DevSpaces is a tool to launch new environments from Github and start to code within seconds of your first time looking at a repository.

Setting up a new project on your local (even with good README's) can be painful, especially if you're new to that particular technology. Typically, I've seen that new developers tend to take about a week before they can hit the ground running by adding new capability to the application. So, DevSpaces can be an effective **ease-into-the-codebase solution** for onboarding new developers. It can also be really helpful for code reviewers to check out the context of how the code in the PR works **without having to switch context** from their current work on their local machines.

So, this was a product that the senior leadership was really excited about. A series of Hackathons were announced to promote and integrate the usage of the product into the different teams in the organization.

## Understand the Hackathon objective

While this seems obvious, its something I generally miss if I'm not consciously thinking about this. I skimmed through all the info and videos that the product had, as well as all info about the Hackathon, to better understand the objective. I determined the primary objective of the Hackathon was to get teams to adopt the product and find ways to be more productive with the tool. They were looking for the tool with the most impact. The most impact not just for your team, but a solution that's extensible to other teams as well (even those working in a different tech stack).

I realized that every team which uses the product would like to set up their environment (be it CloudFormation or any other kind of environment) because that is the single most important value proposition of the product. When working in a local terminal / IDE, we tend to look at our situation and determine what kind of setup we want. This was not directly feasible with DevSpaces because you could have only one config file (for example, we don't have config1.yml vs config2.yml). This was the problem I wanted to solve to enable developers to choose different setups for different situations.

## Understand your objectives

This is different from the previous point, because you can have very different objectives from the intention of the event organizers. This being my first hackathon, I didn't really think about winning it. I just wanted to be able to complete an end-to-end tool/solution that fits the theme and submit it. The objective was to participate, more than trying to attempt a grandiose high-impact idea that could (perhaps) not be achieved in the given time frame. The other objective, was to come out of the other end with a tool that I would end up using on a day-to-day basis going forward. This would ensure that there is a benefit to my effort even if I don't really win anything.

I think having this mindset provided me with the necessary motivation to pull long hours over the weekend since my target was achievable with certainty and had a sure benefit.

## Run a feasibility study

Given the time constraint of a hackathon (~ 3/4 days effectively), you don't have the possibility to explore ideas that don't pan out at the end due to technical limitations. So, its very important to identify the feasibility of ideas as soon as possible. As soon as the brainstorming phase is done, identify what are critical points in your plan that need to be tested for feasibility. Ideally, brainstorm a couple of different ways of solving the same problem you identified.

For my problem, I tested the feasibility of developing the solution with an electron desktop app shell or a chrome extension. Both were feasible to develop my solution, but chrome extension felt natural and made more sense. Another critical point of testing was to identify if DevSpaces had any open API that I could communicate with from my application. It did not, which was a huge blocker. I looked into the docs to find that you could pass environment variables as part of the URL. With this I could develop a solution that could solve the core problem I had, but I still had to scrap a few other ideas because of the no public API limitation.

Having run the feasibility and having tweaked my plan a little, I felt confident enough to actually start the project.

## Setup a minimal project with only tooling that adds to individual productivity

Another important consideration is to identify your repo setup. Given that I was working on the project alone, I had to choose my tooling, taking this into account. For example, I chose to build the extension using React over Angular, because it comes with a simpler setup (especially beneficial for non-production applications). I chose Parcel over Webpack because I knew Parcel was sufficient for my use-case. I only needed babel conversion and static files copy. So, it would be faster to develop with Parcel.

Although I am a **huge** Typescript fan, I decided against writing the application in Typescript because maintaining types and interfaces is more overhead with little to no benefit. Given that I was going to work solo on the project over a short time, I would always have the context of the entire app and types don't really add much value in such situations. Similarly, I decided not to set up linters or formatters except for prettier, and I decided to use Material UI to quickly build components.

## Hardcode or hack non-critical features

Given that your point is to demonstrate the critical features of the application / tooling, it is probably not a good idea to spend time building the necessary but non-critical features. Find ways to hack or hardcode some things as per your situation so that you can focus on the critical stuff.

For example, I needed an AWS user with permissions for some features. But instead of building a full-scale auth solution, I just registered a Cognito user to my identity pool and used a simple sign-in form. This way the tool is still usable on a day-to-day basis, and you can add on a proper auth setup at any point of time.

Another example would be, I hardcoded my environment values for just my environments "ash1" and "ash2", meaning you don't have the ability to add more environments or associate your environments with your Cognito user. But this was not critical for my demonstration, because if the extension worked for two, it was going to work any number 'N'.

## That's all folks!

I learnt a ton participating in the event, and my top 5 takeaways are what I've listed above. I would love to hear from you if you disagree on any of my points or have any thoughts on how to go about being more efficient in developing solutions for Hackathons. Hit me up on LinkedIN. :)
